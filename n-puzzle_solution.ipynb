    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Depth-First Search (DFS) is a fundamental uninformed search algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It is particularly suited for problems where the solution lies deep in the search tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exploration Strategy**: DFS dives deep into a branch until it reaches a goal state or a dead end, at which point it backtracks to explore other branches.  \n",
    "- **Data Structure**: DFS typically uses a stack (explicit or via recursion) to keep track of the nodes to visit.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps in the DFS Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: Start with the initial state and add it to a stack.  \n",
    "2. **Expand Nodes**: Pop a node from the stack and mark it as visited.  \n",
    "3. **Goal Check**: If the current node is the goal state, terminate the search.  \n",
    "4. **Add Neighbors**: Push all unvisited neighbors of the current node onto the stack.  \n",
    "5. **Repeat**: Continue until the goal is found or the stack is empty (indicating no solution exists).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory Usage**: DFS uses less memory compared to breadth-first search (BFS) because it only stores the current branch in the stack.  \n",
    "- **Non-Optimal Solutions**: DFS does not guarantee the shortest or optimal path to the goal, especially in unweighted graphs.  \n",
    "- **Completeness**: In finite graphs, DFS will find a solution if one exists, but it may fail in infinite graphs if it gets stuck exploring an infinitely deep branch.  \n",
    "- **Variants**: Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS) combines the benefits of DFS and BFS to ensure completeness while limiting memory usage.\n"
